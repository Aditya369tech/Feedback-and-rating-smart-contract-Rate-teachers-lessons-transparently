1. Project Title
Clarity Feedback & Rating System

2. Project Description
This project is a smart contract written in Clarity that enables students to rate and provide feedback for teachers or lessons directly on the Stacks blockchain. The contract ensures transparent, tamper-proof ratings that anyone can verify, helping promote trust and quality in education systems using decentralized technologies.

3. Project Vision
The vision of this contract is to provide an immutable, open, and decentralized method for feedback collection. It empowers students with a voice while holding educators accountable and encouraging continual improvement in teaching standards.

4. Future Scope
Add role-based access (e.g., only registered students can rate).

Limit users to one review per teacher.

Allow teachers to reply to feedback.

Display trending or top-rated teachers.

Integrate with a frontend UI for interaction.
